# Memory Management in Plain English

This document covers the memory management features available in Plain English.

## Memory Allocation and Deallocation

### FREEMEM

Used to free up memory that was previously allocated.

Syntax: `FREEMEM(variable)`

- Releases memory that was dynamically allocated during script execution
- After calling FREEMEM, the memory is returned to the system and should not be accessed again
- It's good practice to set the variable to NULL after calling FREEMEM to prevent accidental use

Example usage:
```plainenglish
FREEMEM(SomeVariable)
SomeVariable = NULL
```

## Best Practices

1. Always free memory that you've dynamically allocated when it's no longer needed.
2. Set variables to NULL after freeing them to avoid using deallocated memory.
3. Be careful not to free the same memory more than once, as this can lead to errors.
4. Keep track of allocated memory to ensure all allocations are properly freed.

## Memory Management Tips

1. Use local variables when possible, as they are automatically managed.
2. Be cautious with global variables and ensure they are properly initialized and cleaned up.
3. Consider using data structures that automatically manage memory, if available.
4. Be aware of the memory usage of your application, especially for long-running scripts or applications.
